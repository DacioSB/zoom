# Zoom Clone with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Stream Video SDK

This project is a Zoom-like video conferencing application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and the [Stream Video SDK](https://getstream.io/video/). It provides features such as a personal meeting room, video call integration, and a responsive UI.

## üöÄ Features

- **Personal Meeting Room**: Users can create and join personal meeting rooms.
- **Video Call Integration**: Powered by the Stream Video SDK for seamless video conferencing.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with TailwindCSS for a modern and responsive UI.
- **Dynamic Sidebar**: Navigation links to different sections of the app.
- **Dark Mode**: Customizable dark mode theme.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Styling**: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Video SDK**: [Stream Video SDK](https://getstream.io/video/)
- **Authentication**: [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/)
- **Icons and Images**: Custom assets for navigation and user avatars.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **`/app`**: Contains the main application pages and layouts.
- **`/components`**: Reusable UI components like the Sidebar.
- **`/constants`**: Static data such as sidebar links and avatar images.
- **`/hooks`**: Custom React hooks for API calls and state management.
- **`/lib`**: Utility functions for the project.

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Sidebar Navigation**: The sidebar dynamically highlights the active route using the `usePathname` hook from Next.js.
2. **Personal Room**: Users can join their personal meeting room, with video calls powered by the Stream Video SDK.
3. **Dark Mode**: The app uses Tailwind's `darkMode` configuration for a consistent dark theme.
4. **Responsive Design**: Tailwind's utility classes ensure the app works seamlessly across devices.
